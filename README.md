# TREAT: TranscRiptome EvaluATion

_Treat your assemblies well!_

A pipeline combining docker containers and nextflow for the evaluation of (_de
novo_) transcriptome assembly results.

## Execution

To see all options:
````
nextflow run main.nf --help
````

Simple example execution:
````
nextflow run main.nf --assemblies test_data/rna-spades.fasta --reads test_data/eco.fastq --threads 2 --busco bacteria_odb9 -profile standard
````

## Profiles

The workflow can be deployed in different environments. 

* _standard_: uses docker containers and can be run locally
* _conda_: uses conda environments and can be run locally
* _googlegenomics: uses the google cloud and needs to configured manually to run with your gcloud environment


## Motivation

This workflow implementation was motivated by our study comparing various _de novo_ transcriptome assembly tools:
